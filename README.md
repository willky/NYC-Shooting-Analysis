# NYC-Shooting-Analysis

Recently, there has been a lot of media report about a surge in shooting incidents in New York City. Many reports attribute the rising number of shooting incidents in NYC to the De blasio's and Adams' Administrations soft stands on crime and the lack of police presence in neighborhoods.

This project seeks to analyze the number of shootings across the five borough compared to previous years to understand how things have changed in the City. It also examines the demographics of both shooting victims and perpetrators, and also maps the location of shooting incidents in the City. 

The final product from this analysis is a Tableau dashboard which is currently hosted on Tableau Public. Follow the link in the about section of this repository to access the dashboard. 

This repository contains only contains the NYPD data used to create for the analysis. The data was extracted directly from the NYC Open Data Portal and transformed using R. The R script used for the data extraction and transformation - called `Data Prep.R` has been uploaded to this repository.
